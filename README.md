pywinauto-64
============

This pywinauto branch (0.5.x) supports 64-bit and 32-bit Python 2.x.

It can be installed on Python 3.x, but it seems not working.

Dependency: pyWin32 package only (build 219 is recommended: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/ ), ActiveState Python 2.x contains pyWin32 by default.
